<b>Instructions</b>

<p>

Welcome! In this experiment, you'll be reading English sentences and determining whether or not each sentence sounds like natural, 'grammatical' English. 
</p>
<p>
Before each sentence, you will see a cross ("+") to indicate that you may begin a sentence. When you see the cross, get ready to read a sentence. Press the space bar when you would like to begin, and the first word will appear. You may reveal the next word in the sentence by pressing the space bar again. Continue this way, reading each word until you have read and understood the sentence. In this way, the sentences you read will be presented to you automatically, word by word, at your own pace.
