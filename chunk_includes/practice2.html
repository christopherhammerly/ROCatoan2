<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
The last word of the sentence fragment will have an ellipsis (...). Then you'll be asked to judge whether or not the sentence was 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', as well as how confident you are in your response. To respond that a sentence fragment is grammatical, press the 'F' key; to respond that it is ungrammatical, use the 'J' key. We chose 'F' and 'J' so that you can respond quickly by resting both hands on the keyboard, with your left index finger on 'F' and your right index finger on 'J'. Please DO NOT use a mouse or trackpad.
</p>
<p>
We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so go with your gut instinct about the sentence fragment, and don't overthink your response! To help you go with your first impulse, we're giving you a limit of 2 seconds to respond.
</p>
<p>
After you judge the sentence, you will be asked to rate your confidence in your response using three options. If you are highly confident in your choice, you should choose 'Very confident.' If you're a little unsure, but mostly confident, choose 'Somewhat confident.' If you're not very confident in your response, choose 'Not very confident.' For this, you can use the "1", "2", or "3" keys on the top of the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
It's natural for your confidence to vary quite a lot from response to response, so you should be sure to use all three confidence levels over the course of the experiment. Your intuitions won't always be very clear, and that's OK. Just do your best and go with your gut.
